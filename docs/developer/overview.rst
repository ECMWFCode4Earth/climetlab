Overview
========

*"CliMetLab provides a common place to share code used in the Weather and Climate community to do preprocess data, plot it, and include additional tools, especially for machine leaning purposes."*

The CliMetLab documentation is split as follow

- Getting started: General introduction with the main idea described there.
- User Guide: This is the part you should read if you are using CliMetLab and plugins developed by others.
- Contributor Guide: describes how to create plugins (or yaml files) to add data and functionalities to CliMetLab, to make it available to the users above. In order to avoid rewriting the same code over and over, consider distributing it, the design of CliMetLab allows to do this with plugins.
- **CliMetLab Developers Guide (this part of the documentation)**: The reference documentation of the CliMetLab API and description of its internal architecture. Please refer to this part either if you are willing to develop further CliMetLab or if you want to achieve something that is not possible with the current plugin framework.
